             <h2 id="subtitle">   Our Daily Life </h2>
                 <p class="daily"> The daily life has enormously changed of around 97% people on this planet earth due to this pandemic called as <strong>COVID19</strong>.
                   While it was spreading in China, people around the globe were just visualising through the media, social sites etc... No one was ever prepared for that. People were thinking just as a rumor. But when it arrives in some of the European nations, then it was already late to get prepared. The period of 2-3 months this nations lost just waiting for the virus to come, can be the huge mistake of the 21st century for many countries. <br>
                           </p>
                           <p class="daily"> Now they are saying that the peak in some countries is over but it is still a danger to return back, so each and every person need to be very cautious. A small connection with the virus can lead to an unthinkable result, not only for the person but all of them nearby that person.
                             The people who are living in lockdown and on other measures in their house is getting each and every day difficult. Some are working from home and some are passing their days watching TV. Kids living in an appartment geeting most difficult because the lack of fresh air and sitting whole day inside can lead to frustration and damaging their creativity. The fear about the virus is harming them as well. </p>
                             <p class="daily">  There is nothing that is going to be change drastically but lot of people are on the last phase of the lockdown measures and are counting the days to get out. But as it appears on the news that the people over 65 may need to stay inside until the invention of a vaccine. It is even hard to hear,just imagine how difficult it will be for the older people to implement it. </p>
